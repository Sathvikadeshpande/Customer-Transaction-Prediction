Customer Transaction Prediction

This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will make a transaction based on historical customer data using Machine Learning classification algorithms. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and performance evaluation to identify customer behavior patterns.
